# tsne_pca
- tsne and pca are used for dimensionality reduction. However, tsne has a high computational overhead and is not suitable for complex and large dataset.
- PCA might not give accurate results but computation is quite fast and is scalable.
- PCA can be utilized to check the information and mainly its utilized in feature extraction
- PCA must be used in certain specific conditions only. The data must have a strong linear correlation between the independent variables. There must be high multicollinearity present in the data for PCA to be applied.
- t-SNE is specifically designed for visualization and is known to perform better in this regard.
- t-SNE is mainly used for visualization and exploratory data analysis.

### There are other techniques that are used for clustering data for unsupervised learning such as k-Means, k-Medoids, GMM clustering, DBSCAN, Heirarchical Clustering.
I will explore them in another notebook...
